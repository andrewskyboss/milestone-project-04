### Design Choices
- This project was created based on the target audience needs and requirements. The target audience is a quite wide range of active people who likes sport and want to be in a good shape.
Based on the website theme, were chosen Reddish (International Orange), orange (yellow orange) and three shades of green (Dark state, Midnight Green and Rich black) colors as a main brand colors. 
According to [Color Meanings website]( https://www.color-meanings.com/color-psychology-in-sports/) and Shirley J. Wenrich, author of the book All the Colors of Life: From the History and Mystery of Color, red is the best color for sports as it represents energy and vitality. It’s using as a small accent colors. It’s very handy in gym area. It subconsciously push and supports users to work with the heavy weights.
Orange is inexorably linked to radiant energy. In sports, orange is a great color as it symbolizes strength and endurance. Orange is associated with warmth and the earth. Sports teams and the youth heartily accept this trendy color that combines strength and wisdom. Our orange color is closer to Yellow color. Yellow is the radiant and energetic color of sunshine and warmth. There is no individual who would not feel cheered and comforted when surrounded by vibrant yellow.

- For centuries, green is associated with wealth and health. It also stands for life and the environment. In sports, green represents the will to win and be cheerful. Our green is closer to Blue color. Blue is a calming color in sports. It represents a team or individual that is honest, calm, truthful, and sincere.
All those characteristics are doing unusual but very good combination for the Gym and Fitness Club theme.
Website design is quite dark, but it gives some uniqueness and exclusive club’s atmosphere. People like to get some exclusivity feeling. Gym area is quite individual sport and dark colors does not distract attention from the sport and allows user to concentrate on their tasks.
Differently from the gym sections and information, shopping area’s background color is white and gives user possibility to simple use and read lot of information about shopping products.
Website contains a lot of images, but parallax effect does not overload attention. According to the last trends, design stays clean and simple. 
According to user requirements, website should stay useful, usable and valuable for everybody. To achieve value from design were used user experience five planes:


- **Strategy Plane**  – aiming to achieve in the first place and for whom. The users of this website are people who likes sport and want to get all necessary information about Club and their services. The website should be quite simple and universal for everybody. Navigation is universal for desktop and mobile versions and is quite standard and known by every online user. Traditional rule is no more than 3 clicks to search or get other information was using during the planning and implementing this project.

- **Scope plane** - represents features we want to include into design. 
  - This project includes following features: 
    - Header / Mobile navigation.
    - Registration system.
    - Login functionality.
    - Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality.
    - Intuitive design.
    - SVG logo on top of the page.
    - Grid/Card images as a visual representative.
    - Search functionality.
    - Social media icons.

- **Structure plane** - this project’s information is structured and logically placed into the navigation. As well, this project's content is taken from the database. The structure of Database tables is presented in the [database schemas](DATABASE.md).

- **Skeleton plane** - part for mock-ups:
  - Wireframes links are presented below:
    - [Link to a Wireframes for a Desctop view](assets/documents/project-3-desctop-wireframes.pdf)
    - [Link to a Wireframes for Tablet view ](assets/documents/project-3-tablet-wireframes.pdf)
    - [Link to a Wireframes for Mobile view ](assets/documents/project-3-mobile-wireframes.pdf)

- **Surface plane** - it is a final part of design procedure. The project is built in modern design using parallax effect on many images. The project is orientated more into the data manipulating and working with shopping bag and payment system. However, the website stays modern design, useful, usable, and valuable for everybody.

#### Colors
The color palette were created using information from resources about The Psychology Behind Colors in Sports: How They Matter.  [Color Meanings website]( https://www.color-meanings.com/color-psychology-in-sports/) by  Shirley J. Wenrich, author of the book All the Colors of Life: From the History and Mystery of Color.

- The color brand one is Reddish color (International Orange). It is using for H1 titles and button hovers to attract attention.
- The color brand two is Orange color (Yellow Orange). It is used for H2 titles and different buttons. to attract attention. The color is working very well as a contrast color for the third brand color. Both red and yellow are also effective at grabbing attention.
- The color brand three is Green color (Dark state, Midnight Green(a) and Rich black(b)). It is used for H3 titles and in many section / grids / cards as a background colors. In this project were used three shades of green color to do some gradient effect on the page.
- The color brand four is Languid Levander color. It is used as neutral base color on some lines and backgrounds.
- The color brand five is a Dark Jungle Green color. It is dark color and used for main content font on white backgrounds and all dark design elements to make them visible to user. This color is used for the footer background as a finishing page gradient color.

- Color palete was created using [Coolors resources](https://coolors.co)
- ![color scheme](assets/images/colors.PNG)


#### Typography
- Roboto sans-serif typeface family font was using in this project for the body text. Body font size is 16px. This body font is very common as neutral, easy to read and good for design. It is very universal and has very wide range of font weights.
- All titles H1 and H2 are in Oswald sans-serif font’s family.
- H3 titles are in Roboto Mono monospace font’s family.
- All H4 – H6 titles are in Oswald sans-serif typeface font’s family.
- According to Google Font, Oswald is a reworking of the classic style historically represented by the 'Alternate Gothic' sans serif typefaces. Font is narrow and looks very elegant for the fitness sections.
- Roboto Mono is optimized for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. Added serifs makes this font standout from the Roboto font family and looks like barbell from the Gym. 
-  H1 as main title is in size of 50px. It is quite big size but looks very stylish and attract attention. H2 title is in size of 40px. H3 titles are in size of 30px.
- All fonts are reduced in size for mobile devices to fit into the small screen of devices:
- H1 = 40px, H2 = 35px, H3 = 27px.
- body font is in same size for mobile devices.


- Font examples are presented below:
- H1 Oswald 50px ![H1 Title Oswald 50px](assets/images/h1.PNG)
